# Binary Classification on Pima India Dataset
- This repository contains a data science project on Binary Classification applied to Diabetes Identification using the Pima India Dataset. The analysis is presented in a Jupyter Notebook, providing insights into the factors influencing Diabetes and predicting the outcomes of unseen data.
- The dataset used is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset.
